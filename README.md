A website for tracking sales, communication with sponsors, and assets received from sponsors for BFIG. It included a number of tools, groupings, and configurability to be very flexible from year to year. It utilized jQuery and Bootstrap for the front-end and Flask for the back-end.

Unforunately, it was never completed, and BFIG chose to go with an enterprise sales tool. As such, it is now abandoned.
